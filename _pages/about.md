I am a 2nd-year PhD student in Biomedical Informatics and Data Science at [Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis](https://medicine.washu.edu/), within the [Institute for Informatics, Data Science, and Biostatistics](https://i2db.wustl.edu/). My research focuses on leveraging large language models and rule-based systems for clinical entity extraction and improving patient care. I am interested in the safe and effective deployment of AI in healthcare. 

Current projects include predictive modeling for Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1), developing LLM prompting methodologies for clinical information extraction (e.g., retrieval-augmented generation and divide-and-conquer approaches), and advancing the transfer of interoperable NLP technologies across academic medical centers.

I graduated with a B.S. in Data Science from the [WashU McKelvey School](https://engineering.washu.edu/index.html) of Engineering in December 2023, and joined my PhD program the next year. I am co-advised by my amazing advisors Drs. [Philip R. O. Payne](https://i2db.wustl.edu/people/philip-payne/) and [Aditi Gupta](https://i2db.wustl.edu/people/aditi-gupta-phd/).
